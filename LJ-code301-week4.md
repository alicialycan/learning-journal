# LJ Code 301 - Week 4

## January 2, 2018

This week I learned how to store objects in a database so they are available for users from an external source. I did this by using NPM PostgreSQL to set up communications to the database from my text editor.
I went through the code and analyzed it for it's overall functionality as well as to explain what was going on with the data associated with each SQL statement.
I also learned how to utilize SQL to join data together in a database and access it based on specific criteria. For example, in our blog application I wrote a SQL query to join all data from the articles and the authors tables I created on the id value of each when the articles were retrieved. I then wrote a query to create a new article, and a query to update records. Lastly, I went through the code with CRUD testing to make sure everything was working properly.

I'm really enjoying learning the backend and I'm looking forward to digging much deeper and being able to deploy my code. I am challenging myself with these concepts by designing my own application to practice creating a database, setting up server communications and creating multiple forms for the user to view data, insert, and delete data from a table.
