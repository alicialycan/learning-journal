This week I learned how to add functionality of removing and updating records from a database through the use of middleware. I learned M-V-C architecture and how to create different views with front-end and back-end purposes. I also learned how to build the feature to my app of an administrator interface, which will only allow modifications to the database when the user is 'authenticated'.

The most challenging part was setting up routes for client side routing which included different endpoint functionality depending on which view or page the user was on/or action they took.
