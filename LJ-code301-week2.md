# LJ Code 301 - Week 2

## December 9, 2017

This week I learned how to build off my Javasctipt skills adding in JQuery, ES6 arrow functions, event handlers, and Handlebar templates to create a responsive Blog design application.

Specifically, I learned how to write methods to filter categories in order to render a selecion of attributes of my choosing to display. I learned how to refactor concatenations using template literals when building DOM elements to append to an element. I learned how to create a new template to display the objects in my array in order to increase the scope of the application to allow the user to easily edit the way posts are rendered. I also learned how to convert my existing HTML template into a Handlebars template and update the methods within it. I learned a lot this week!

I am really enjoying these new concatenations and libraries we started utilizing this week. I find the code to be more readable, quicker to write, and drier. I do find it a bit confusing to know when to pull from a certain library or use different refactoring methods for best practice, but I am very excited to add these tools to my toolbox and grow my skillset with each of them. Pair programming has been a great experience too with a new partner this week. I found I had a good opportunity to explain a lot of these concepts this week as my partner struggled with a few of the concepts. As a result, this helped me deepen my understanding of these fundamental foundational concepts.
