# LJ Code 301 - Week 1

## December 4, 2017

This was the first week of our Code Fellows 301 course and it started off fast! I found it both challenging, exciting, and rewarding. Learning to write in JQuery notation instead of Javascript was the most challenging aspect of this first week. I am grasping the concept, but have yet to become a master of it. I like challenges so I've been working hard to really nail down these key concepts of mobile-first design, MVC architecture, and JQuery notation, with some CSS/HTML thrown in there as well.

I found pair-programming to be a great opportunity to learn the concepts this week well. My pair programming partner, Dennis, and I worked together through the labs and assignments this week and in the end we reached our destination together. Dennis struggled with a few items in the labs and I was able to help him understand them, in turn this helped me learn them better.

I expected JQuery to build onto Javascript, while it does, it wasn't quite what I expected. Also, pair-programming took a lot longer to complete the assignments as we we're both learning together.
