# LJ Code 301 - Week 3

## December 28, 2017

This week I learned how to create new articles and allow users to retrieve those new articles with npm init and package.json. I became more familiar with ExpressJS and NPM so that I could set up a server file to handle HTTP requests and deliver responses. I had to make sure the server was listening for incoming requests and that the application was functioning correctly. I was able to increase functionality of the application by creating access to the form for the user to easily add new articles or receive a 404 error message for invalid requests.

Next, I learned how to store my articles (from the blog application we have been working with in our lab projects) in a database so they are available for users from an external source. I learned how to examine my code more carefully to really understand it's overall function. I accomplished this by setting up several new routes in server.js and experimenting with SQL statements on test data.

The material is becoming increasingly more challenging as the concepts grow and we are only learning the surface of these new topics. However, I'm starting to see how it all fits together and is more efficient than what we we're doing before with basic javascript. I'm looking forward to learning more about communicating on the backend!
