# LJ Code 301 - Week 6

## January 8, 2018

This week I learned how to use functional programming with CRUD operations to create a fully functioning application with MVC architecture. I learned a lot about APIs, PSQL, creating and building server communications from scratch, deploying applications to Heroku, and why asynchronous programming is powerful.

The most challenging part of this past week for me was resolving errors in my code and the PSQL database syntax. My 'aha' moment was when I was able to implement ajax to replace the templates I previusly had to create drier functional programming within my application. I really enjoyed building the book application from scratch into a fully functional application to deploy via heroku. All the pieces came together for me there!
